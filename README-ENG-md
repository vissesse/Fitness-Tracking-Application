## The fitness tracking 

This application is a tool that allows users to monitor their physical activities, log workouts, set goals, and track their progress over time.

Main Features
Activity Registration

    Register Different Types of Activities: Running, walking, cycling, swimming, etc.
    Set Parameters: Distance, duration, calories burned, etc.

Workout Logging

    Allow Users to Log Specific Workouts: Include date, time, and type of activity.
    Store Additional Details: Location (via GPS), time, distance, pace, etc.

Goal Setting

    Set Personal Goals: For example, run 100 km per month or swim 5 km per week.
    Notifications: Alerts when goals are achieved or when the user is close to achieving them.

Progress Monitoring

    Statistics and Graphs: Show user progress over time.
    Performance Comparison: Compare performance across different periods.

Integration with Monitoring Devices

    Sync with Smartwatches and Other Devices: Automatic import of activity data.

Social Media Sharing

    Share Achievements and Goals: Allow users to share their successes on social media.

Project Architecture
System Layers

    Presentation Layer (API)
        Controllers: Expose RESTful endpoints to interact with the system.
        DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Data structures for information exchange between the presentation layer and the application.

    Application Layer
        Application Services: Coordinate application logic and orchestrate operations between different components.
        Mappers: Convert between domain entities and DTOs.

    Domain Layer
        Entities: Represent real-world objects like Activity, Workout, Goal, User.
        Aggregates: Groups of entities treated as a unit (e.g., Goal composed of Activity and User).
        Repositories: Interfaces for data persistence and retrieval.
        Domain Services: Implement complex business logic.
        Domain Events: Notifications of important occurrences in the domain (e.g., goal achieved).

    Infrastructure Layer
        Concrete Repositories: Implement repository interfaces using a database.
        External Integrations: Services for syncing with monitoring devices and third-party APIs.

Domain Modeling
Activity Domain

    Entity: Activity
        Attributes: id, type, date, duration, distance, calories, location.

Workout Domain

    Entity: Workout
        Attributes: id, date, activity, user.
        Relationship: Workout belongs to a User and contains an Activity.

Goal Domain

    Entity: Goal
        Attributes: id, description, type, target, progress, user.
        Relationship: Goal belongs to a User and is associated with one or more Activities.

User Domain

    Entity: User
        Attributes: id, name, email, password, activities, workouts, goals.

Implementation of TDD

To ensure code quality and correct implementation of functionalities, we will follow the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, which includes three main steps: Red, Green, Refactor.

    Red: Write a test that initially fails.
    Green: Write the minimum code necessary to pass the test.
    Refactor: Refactor the code to improve quality without breaking the test.

Tests

    Unit Tests
        Verify the creation of a new Activity with valid attributes.
        Correct calculation of calories burned based on distance and duration.
        Verify the logic for updating the progress of a Goal.

    Integration Tests
        Test the integration between the Activity repository and the application layer.
        Verify the complete workflow of logging a Workout and updating a Goal.

    Acceptance Tests
        Simulate the user flow for registering an activity, setting a goal, and monitoring progress.
        Test data synchronization from external devices and progress updates.
